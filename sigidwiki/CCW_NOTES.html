<center><h1> CCW NOTES </h1>
<h4>By Peter Lumb G3IRM</h4>

<p> These notes have been prepared by G3IRM to give you
some idea how coherent c.w. operates.   As you all will know,
morse code consists of dots and dashes arranged to represent
letters, figures and punctuation marks.   The basic element is
the dot which has a predetermined length depending on the speed
of transmission.   High speeds require short dots.  Hand sent
morse code and for that matter code sent with semi-automatic and
automatic keys is random in nature and, even if the characters
are correctly sent, the spaces can vary considerably.

<p> The standard speed for coherent c.w. adopted by Ray
Petit W7GHM when he designed the system was 12 words per minute. 
In actual fact it was the dot length which he decided should be
fixed at 100 milliseconds.   An element space was, therefore,
also 100 milliseconds, a dash and character space were each equal
to 300 milliseconds and all other spaces were multiples of the
same 100 milliseconds.   This timing is still in use today and
is available on both the COHERENT and PCW programs available for
coherent c.w.   By connecting two computers together via the
RS232 interfaces, one running COHERENT and the other running PCW,
perfect communication can be achieved proving their
compatibility.   Only transceivers need be added at each end for
on-the-air communication.

<p>  Coherent c.w. depends entirely on accurate timing based
on the element length.   If you imagine two square waves both
identical in timing but derived from separate oscillators and
having the mark length equal to the space length and both these
equal to 100 milliseconds it will be obvious that, if they both
start together, they will stay in step indefinitely if the clocks
generating them are perfectly stable.   The original hardware
coherent c.w. system was based on this principle and highly
stable standard oscillators and transceivers were required at
both ends of the contact.   The difficulty of providing these is
the major reason why coherent c.w. did not become popular.

<p> Modern computer programs have changed all that and now
only reasonably stable transceivers and no frequency standards
are required but it is obvious that the more stable transceivers
and computers used in the system are the better will be the
results.

<p> I must now return to our two square waves.   These can
be looked upon as strings of dots each dot and space being of a
definite length.  If we now arrange for one station to send a
string of dots these will only be received accurately if the
timimg at the receiving end corresponds to our identical second
square wave.   Assuming that perfect timing exists at both ends
the only thing that will stop correct reception is the relative
phase of the two square waves.   If the rising edge of one square
wave occurs at exactly the same time as the rising edge of the
other the signals will be sychronized (coherent) and all
following transitions will correspond.   Using the original Petit
hardware filter this was achieved by the transmitting station
sending a string of dots and the receiving station adjusting a
phasing control until the string of dots was received clearly and
distinctly.   Once this was done and, assuming perfect timing,
the stations would stay in step indefinitely.   Dots and dashes
transmitted would be received at the other end of the contact and
as spaces no matter how long were all multiples of the element
length, a dot or dash received after a space would still occur
on the rising edge of the receiver clock.   This is a somewhat
simplified explanation of how coherent c.w. works but it will
give you some idea of the principle behind the system.   Let me
repeat that in order to ensure correct operation all oscillators
had to be exceptionally accurate and, above all, stable.

<p> There are two coherent c.w. programs available.   The
first is called COHERENT and was written by Bill de Carle VE2IQ
and it can be obtained from him.   The other is PCW which was
adapted from Bill's program and rewritten by Ernst Schroder DJ7HS
to appeal to the operator rather than the experimenter.   This
is the program you will find on this disk under the name PCW.

<p> The need for stable oscillators has been overcome in
both programs.   Automatic synchronization has been included so
there is no need to have phasing controls.   If the program
receives a string of coherent c.w. dots it will automatically
synchronize.   Computer clocks and all but the best transceivers
can drift a little and provision is made in both programs for the
automatic correction of frequency drift.   In COHERENT this is
done by feeding pulses from the computer to the up/down frequency
control lines of suitable transceivers.   The recent Kenwood
models such as the TS850 and TS450 are ideal as these can be
controlled in steps of one hertz though models made by other
makers may also be suitable.   As everyone does not own such a
transceiver DJ7HS decided to make the software carry out
automatic tuning.   No up/down lines are therefore required when
using the PCW program.

<p> DJ7HS has provided sufficient notes and on-screen help
to enable you to run the program.   It can be used to send c.w.
as well as coherent c.w. (but only at the three speeds provided)
as they are in fact exactly the same so far as transmitting is
concerned.   This is done by simply connecting the computer to
the key input of the transceiver.   Bear in mind though that the
output of the computer is at RS232 levels and an interface may
be needed to connect this to the keying line of the transceiver. 
A single insulated gate field effect transistor is all that is
normally needed.   Consult your transceiver manual.   The program
can only be used to receive coherent c.w. if the VE2IQ interface
board is included between the receiver output and the computer.

<p> Any transceiver will receive coherent c.w. as it is
exactly the same as c.w. with the exception that it is timed
extremely accurately and is, therefore, "perfect" morse code.  
This means that anyone hearing it can easily assume that ordinary
c.w. is being sent.   If you are prepared to receive the signal
from the other station as c.w. you can, of course, make contact. 
In order to indicate that you can operate coherently it is
necessary to include something in your call to this effect.   You
can send a string of dots (by pressing $) followed by CQ CCW DE
<callsign> and possibly more dots.   This will enable another
coherent station to synchronize and call you.   If you do not
send the string of dots the calling station will have to send
them to enable you to synchronize.

<p> You are sure to receive calls from c.w. stations even
though you indicate that you are using coherent c.w.   They
either will not know what CCW means and assume that you have a
funny way of calling CQ or they may be curious to know what CCW
is all about.   Please take the opportunity to tell them.

<p>  Unlike some of the digital modes where it may be a
little difficult to decide which type of signal is being
received, coherent c.w. is easy to recognise by its perfect
timing and string of preliminary dots.   Even so you will have
difficulty finding stations as there are not many stations active
at the time of writing.   For some time now it has been the
practice of coherent operators to use one frequency.   Various
frequencies have been tried.   At one time frequencies one
kilohertz up from the usual QRP frequencies were used as it was
thought that QRP operators had the most to gain from coherent
c.w. and they may be tempted to make enquiries.    This did not
prove to be the case.   It is now suggested that twenty kilohertz
up from the bottom of each band be used.   There is sure to be
some interference whichever frequencies are chosen but coherent
c.w. with its accurate timing and very narrow bandwidths stands
a good chance of being heard.   For the time being please use
these frequencies and watch for any announcement of changes in
the Digital Journal.   I will try to ensure that other magazines
are notified of any changes.

<p> I hope you will enjoy using coherent c.w. and that we
will have more activity in the near future.

<p> Details of activity or any other items of interest are
always welcome for inclusion in the coherent column of the
Digital Journal.   Please send them to me:
