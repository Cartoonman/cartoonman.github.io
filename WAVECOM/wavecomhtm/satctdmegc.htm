<p class="BodySub-Title">Introduction</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Inmarsat C maritime mobile satellite system has an 
inherent capability, known as Enhanced Group Call (EGC), which allows broadcast 
messages to be made to selected groups of ship stations located anywhere within 
a satellite's coverage. Four geostationary satellites provide worldwide coverage 
for these types of broadcasts. Two types of EGC services are available: Safety 
NET and Fleet NET. Fleet NET is a commercial messaging services offered by 
Inmarsat, and is not recognized by the Global Maritime Distress &amp; Safety 
System, or GMDSS. Safety NET, along with NAVTEX, is recognized by the GMDSS as 
the primary means for disseminating maritime safety information. Ships regulated 
by the Safety of Life at Sea Convention travelling outside areas covered by 
NAVTEX must carry an Inmarsat C Safety NET receiver by 1 February 1999.</p>
<p class="BodySub-Title">Safety NET Services</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Virtually all navigatable waters of the world are covered 
by Inmarsat satellites. Each satellite transmits EGC traffic on a designated 
channel at 1.5 GHz. Any ship sailing within the coverage area of an Inmarsat 
satellite will be able to receive all Safety NET messages broadcast over this 
channel by that satellite. All Inmarsat C maritime ship stations can monitor the 
EGC channel. The EGC channel can also be monitored by dedicated receive-only 
equipment installed separately or as part of an Inmarsat A station.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The International Maritime Organization has announced that 
by June 1998, broadcasts of navigational and meteorological information will be 
made for every NAV/MET Area of the globe. Search and Rescue information is also 
broadcast in most areas.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Ships located outside a circular or rectangular area will 
not receive a message addressed to these areas, provided the Inmarsat C 
satellite terminal is connected to a GPS or similar navigational receiver, or 
the ship's position has been recently updated manually. If the terminal is not 
connected to a navigational receiver, then it will receive all such messages. 
Ships will receive all messages addressed to a NAVAREA if the user has entered 
the NAVAREA number into the terminal.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The printing of messages already received correctly is 
automatically suppressed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Safety NET messages include a special header consisting of 
five "C" codes:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">Ø </span>C1 - priority code - 1 digit - distress,

<p class="MsoBodyText">The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) maintains 
the Safety NET Users Handbook on the Inmarsat Homepage, and is available at no 
charge (http://www.inmarsat.com/Maritimesafety/snet.pdf).</p>
<p class="BodySub-Title">Receiving Broadcasts</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most Inmarsat C terminals will not receive a safety 
broadcast if it is transmitting a message, or if it is tuned to an Inmarsat 
ocean region not used for safety broadcasts in the area travelled. Most Safety 
NET messages are rebroadcast after 6 minutes, to give a transmitting terminal 
time to receive missed messages. Lists of Safety NET broadcast schedules and 
areas have been published by the JOINT WMO/IOC COMMISSION FOR OCEANOGRAPHY AND 
MARINE METEOROLOGY to assist ship operators tune Inmarsat C terminals to the 
proper Inmarsat ocean region.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although reception of Safety NET traffic is automatic, the 
shipboard operator must set up the receiver properly at the start of the 
voyage:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">Ø </span>Select the appropriate broadcast 
channel. This can often be accomplished by logging on to a land earth station in 
the ocean region for which needed broadcasts are made.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">Ø </span>Select the NAVAREA identification 
code.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">Ø </span>If travelling near Australia, select the 
proper coastal area codes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">Ø </span>Ensure the Inmarsat C station is 
connected to a working navigational receiver. If a connection cannot be made, 
the ship's position must be manually updated every four hours during the ship's 
voyage. Without these updates, reams of unnecessary broadcast messages will be 
received.</p>
<p class="BodySub-Title">Broadcast Channel Information</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The modulation rate of the broadcast channel is 1200 Baud. 
Forward error correction is applied to this, creating an effective information 
transfer of 600 bits per second (rate 1/2 convolutional coding with interleaving 
is used to disperse error bursts which arise when deep fades are present). This 
ensures that there is a high probability of receiving a message correctly at the 
first transmission, irrespective of the atmospheric conditions or the ship's 
position within the satellite coverage.</p>
